# Using References

Templates are your primary tool for writing READMEs. References provide depth - use them to refine your understanding or handle edge cases.

**Tip:** Don't load all references at once. Pick the one most relevant to your situation.

### make-a-readme.md
`references/make-a-readme.md`

**Why:** Practical, section-by-section guidance for what to include
**What:** Walks through each common section (Name, Description, Installation, Usage, etc.) with concrete suggestions. Good reminder: "too long is better than too short"
